# Data and code for the construction and characterization of phagemid tracers

Data and code associated with a manuscript describing the design and
characterization of phagemid-based DNA tracer particles. These tracers were
constructed provide a way to directly characterize wastewater-based pathogen
monitoring systems. The particles are modified versions of the M13 virus that
are biologically inactive and contain synthetic DNA barcodes which can be
measured by qPCR or amplicon sequencing.
